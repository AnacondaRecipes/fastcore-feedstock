  description: |
    Python is a powerful, dynamic language. Rather than bake everything into 
    the language, it lets the programmer customize it to make it work for them. 
    fastcore uses this flexibility to add to Python features inspired by other 
    languages we've loved, like multiple dispatch from Julia, mixins from Ruby, 
    and currying, binding, and more from Haskell. It also adds some 
    “missing features” and clean up some rough edges in the Python standard 
    library, such as simplifying parallel processing, and bringing ideas 
    from NumPy over to Python's list type.
